<h1 align="center"> Crash Course: CRUD Operations with MongoDB </h1>

This repository is designed **for beginners** to learn the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB. MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. For visualization, MongoDB Compass is used. It a powerful GUI for querying, aggregating, and analyzing your MongoDB data in a visual environment. 


# Install

### Clone the repository:

          git clone https://github.com/Lizahh/CRUD-operations-with-MongoDB

### Install the requiements:
  
          pip3 install -r requirements.txt
          
# Description:

  * This repository contains four major python modules: Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting
  * User needs to install all the libraries by following the requirements.txt file using pip3 (for Python3.x users)
  * The most important requirment is to install the MongoDB and Mongo Compass in the system
  * As the course is designed for the complete beginners so the following steps can be followed to run the code in editor (e.g. Visual Studio)
  
# Usage:

   1. The first step would be to connecting the Mongo Compass as local host in system:
   
   ![Creating Connection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44564025/177032709-c9051b47-2d86-44ab-98c4-3cf3cca37603.png)
   
   2. The next step is to run module 'Creating.py' for creating the database of your own choice
   
   3. After that, a database of that name will be created Mongo DB and can be visualized in Mongo Compass GUI as following:

   4. Now you can run any file, Reading.py (for finding/reading records), Updating.py (for modifying records) and Deleting.py (to delete records) and check the correspodning results in Mongo Compass in parallel
         
   5. User can also add queries for performing any operation of CRUD. Query making is also performed in the python modules
   
   6. The users can also upload files on their database by directly adding through Mongo Compass GUI:

   7. The data can be viewed in any form through the GUI as shown below:
   
   * In an order as the user enters:

   * In form of dictionary:

   * In tubular format (most convenient):
